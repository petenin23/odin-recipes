        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius.</li>
            <li>Wash the chicken pieces well, remove excess fat, blood and any remaining organs. Do not remove the skin under any circumstances.</li>
            <li>Chop the onion and bell pepper into julienne strips.</li>
            <li>Cut the potatoes into thin wheels.</li>
            <li>Grease a baking tray with a little oil and make a bed with the potatoes and put the onion and pepper on top.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken on a wooden board and season the pieces on all their faces with the spices. Do it to your liking.</li>
            <li>You can spice up the potatoes, onions and peppers a little too.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken on the tray with the skin facing up.</li>
            <li>Put in the oven and let cook for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take out the tray, turn the chicken pieces over and put them back in the oven.</li>
            <li>After about 20 more minutes the chicken should be fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Check it by pricking it with a long wooden toothpick or a knife through the center, near the bone, if no blood comes out, it is ready.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the oven again and flip the pieces one more time so the skin is facing up.</li>
            <li>Now you can turn the temperature up a bit and let them brown slightly. But you have to be careful, if you are careless you could get burned.</li>
            <li>When they are golden to your liking, turn off the oven and let them rest for a couple of minutes.</li>
